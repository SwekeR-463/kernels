### Notes
* BFS is often used to discover the shortest number of edges that one needs to take in order to go from one vertex to another vertex of the graph
* Maze routing in integrated circuits—an application for breadth-first search
* Ping-pong buffering, also known as double buffering, is a technique that uses two buffers to increase memory bandwidth and data transfer rates
