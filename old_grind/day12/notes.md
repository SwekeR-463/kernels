### Notes
* Naturally, CUDA applications tend to process a massive amount of data from the global memory within a short period of time
* memory coalescing techniques that can more effectively move data from the global memory into shared memories and registers 
* modern DRAMs use parallelism to increase their rate of data access, commonly referred to as memory access throughput
