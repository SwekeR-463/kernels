### To-Do's
- [x] cuBLAS Dot product kernel
- [x] ch17 pmpp
- [x] conv forward pass kernel with cuBLAS

### Notes
* The first goal is to solve a given problem in less time
* The second goal of using parallel computing is to solve bigger problems within a given amount of time
* The third goal of using parallel computing is to achieve better solutions for a given problem and a given amount of time
* In order for a problem to be solved with parallel computing, the problem must be formulated in such a way that the large problem can be decomposed into sub-problems that can be safely solved at the same time
